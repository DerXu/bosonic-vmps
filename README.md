# bosonic-vmps
This Matlab program was originally developed to study the critical properties of the spin-boson model. It can be easily extended to study other boson systems like Boseâ€“Hubbard model as well.

Matlab or Octave is needed to run the program. For example, to calculate the ground state of spin-boson model with certain set of parameters, you can run the following command in Matlab:

~~~
VMPS_SBM1(0,0,0.6,0.1,2,50,0)
~~~

The definition of the parameters can be found in the source code.

This program has been used in our paper "Critical and Strong-Coupling Phases in One- and Two-Bath Spin-Boson Models" Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 160401 (2012) . Please consider citing this paper if you use the code for your project.
